icyN0057_Makefile is the file to use to build the dynamic library
ucac2_subroutines.so. The file Makefile is identical to icyN0057_Makefile

idl5.4_ucac2_subroutines.so and idl6.0_ucac2_subroutines.so are
built for idl versions 5.4 and 6.0 using the N0057 ICY package 
compiled for idl5.4 & 6.0 respectively.

The ICY package is available for download from the naif anonymous 
ftp site

naif.jpl.nasa.gov:/pub/naif/toolkit/IDL/

For IDL 5.4 and earlier change 

icyN0057_ucac2_subroutines_c_wrappers to ucac2_subroutines_c_wrappers 
whereever it appears in the Makefile
