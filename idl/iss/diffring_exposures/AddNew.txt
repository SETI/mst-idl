How to add new data to the diffring_exposures analysis:

; First define the image directory and the savefile (change this as necessary):
dir = '025/G150PHASE/'
savefile = '~/idl/iss/diffring_exposures/025_g150phase.sav'

;1) Add directory to the big case statement at the top of diffring_exposures.pro
;2) Add the appropriate indices to eruns and gruns in run_diffring_exposures.pro
;3) Move diffring_exposures.sav to a new name (perhaps add ".old2").
;4) To create the new savefile, 
run_diffring_exposures
;5) Now transfer relevant data to immax.sav in the image directory,
.res
restore, savefile
save, immax, ims, emission, phase, $
      filename='/home/borogove/iss/images/'+dir+'immax.sav'
;6) Now go to the image directory, and double-check immax:
restore, 'immax.sav'
movie_wait = -1
.run caviar_movie
; For each image, if immax is not the point of maximum ring brightness:
cursor, x, y, 1, /dev
immax[*,j] = [x,nl-y]
; Or to remove the image entirely:
immax[*,j] = -1
; After immax for all images have been checked, and updated if necessary,
; save the new values, and update the photometric angles:
@save_immax
.run immax_update_angles

; Now we need to redo the extraction, so delete savefile and
; diffring_exposures.sav, then
run_diffring_exposures

;To check the effects on phase curves:
allfilters = 1
.run phasecurves

; To check the background model curves:
bg = 1 
allfilters = 1 
bgonly = 1
niceplot = 1
.run phasecurves
