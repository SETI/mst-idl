This repository shares the personal software library of Matthew Tiscareno.  It is offered without any warranty or any expectation that it will work on your machine.  The software is generally written in IDL.  Some versions of other software packages are included in the versions that I have used.

Any questions should be directed to Matthew Tiscareno (matt@seti.org).
